# WEBD 1000 - Assignment 1 

##  Tutorial 1 Case Problem 2 (HTML 81)

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- The textbook starter files for the Case Problem have already been loaded into the GitHub repository for you
- Make the required changes in the cloned folder, and **commit & push** the entire folder up to GitHub 
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

###  Important Note: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

### Tasks:  

Complete Case Problem #2 from Tutorial 1 on page **HTML 81**(Section 1-25g) of the textbook.

You can also refer to the screen shots below for an example of what the two pages of the website not pictured in the textbook should mostly look like.

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. NotePad++) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 1 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
